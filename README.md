# Building-a-Scalable-Data-Warehouse-and-ETL-Pipeline
Constructing a robust data pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) data into a scalable data warehouse.

The project titled "Building a Scalable Data Warehouse and ETL Pipeline" focuses on constructing a robust data pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) data into a scalable data warehouse. Here's a detailed analysis and description of the project:

# Objective:
The aim of the project is to build a scalable ETL pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources (CSV, JSON, API), transforms it using PySpark, and prepares it for loading into a data warehouse. This setup is essential for supporting large-scale data analytics and reporting in enterprise environments.

# Key Components:
Data Extraction:

CSV Data: Product data is extracted from a CSV file using Pandas.
JSON Data: Customer data is read from a JSON file, normalized, and loaded into a DataFrame.
API Data: Transactional data is retrieved from a REST API (dummyjson.com), and responses are converted into a DataFrame using Pandas.
Data Transformation with PySpark:

PySpark is used to handle large-scale data processing. Some of the transformations applied include:
Filtering: Filtering products with prices greater than a specified threshold.
Aggregations: Grouping product data by category and calculating the average price.
Stock Analysis: Identifying products that have high stock levels (greater than 100 units).
PySpark is leveraged here to ensure scalability and efficient processing of potentially large datasets.
Data Loading:
Though not explicitly shown in the extracted code, the project likely includes loading the transformed data into a data warehouse. This process is critical in making the data available for further analytics, 
reporting, or machine learning models.

# Technologies Used:
Pandas: For initial data extraction and manipulation from CSV and API sources.
PySpark: For scalable data processing, filtering, and aggregation.
API Integration: REST API for retrieving real-time data.
JSON Parsing: To extract and normalize data from JSON sources.
Project Workflow:
Data Extraction: Data from multiple sources (CSV, JSON, and API) is ingested and loaded into DataFrames.
Data Transformation: Data is processed using PySpark for filtering, grouping, and aggregation.
Data Loading: The final step would involve loading the cleaned and transformed data into a data warehouse for analysis.

# Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how to build a scalable data pipeline using PySpark for processing large datasets and ingesting data from various formats. It showcases essential ETL processes, including extracting data from diverse sources, transforming it to meet business requirements, and preparing it for loading into a data warehouse for further analysis. This approach is key in enterprise data management, enabling efficient large-scale data handling and analytics. ​​
